Across the world, more than 430 million people experience disabling hearing loss. For many in the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) community, 
sign languages are the primary means of communication. These languages are not simply visual equivalents of spoken languagesâ€”they are fully 
developed linguistic systems with their own grammar, structure, and cultural significance. However, accessibility barriers remain widespread 
due to a shortage of qualified sign language interpreters and limited technological support.

Sign language translation, which involves converting rich visual-gestural input into spoken or written language, presents unique challenges. 
Unlike spoken languages, sign languages are inherently multi-modal, involving hand gestures, facial expressions, and body posture. These 
features make the translation task complex, especially in the absence of large annotated datasets and standardized benchmarks.

The Workshop on Workshop on Sign Language Processing (WSLP) aims to address this disparity. The goal of this
workshop is to explore innovative approaches and methodologies for translating sign languages, with a particular focus on low-resource settings.
We invite researchers and practitioners working on diverse sign languages to come together, share their work, discuss challenges, and foster 
collaborations that can drive progress in this critical field.
